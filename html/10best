        <p><span class="article-bold">Website Goal</span><br>
        The site goal for <span class="article-bold">m2mblue.com</span> is to <span class="article-underline">sell a service</span> that they provide. This service is called “global connectivity specialist” and is described as global wireless connectivity and services. The web page is dedicated to selling this service as well as educate us on what the service is.</p>
        <p><span class="article-bold">Target Audience</span><br>
        The target audience for this website would be <span class="article-bold">35–55</span> and most likely be businesses, companies, etc. That would be the main group that would purchase the services. Given the technology and money that would be involved in the data and wireless connectivity that this website and company has to offer, it would exclude both younger and older generations as well as individuals who aren’t apart of a company that would need this kind of service.</p>
        <p><span class="article-bold">Navigation</span><br>
        As for navigation within the website, it is similar to most websites where there is a navigation menu in the header as well as links and breadcrumbs near the titles of each page to make it easy to navigate from page to page as well as to sub pages. The header navigation contains drop down lists and text for the links. The website has a good usage of breadcrumbs within the URL as well as on top of the information and topics to allow the visitors to navigate back to previous pages rather than using the back arrow. Each page is consistent with the rest when it comes to layout, hierarchy and color scheme. Another consistent element throughout the web page is the use of contrast, which provides excellent depth and draws the visitors in to read and explore the information being presented. All the links within the page are labeled accurately which aids the reader when it comes to navigating to the pages and topics that they are interested with ease. This also helps with the visitor knowing what they are viewing and how they got there. Lastly, the home page does an exceptional job of providing navigation elements so that from the home page, a visitor is capable of exploring all available pages through the links in the header as well as throughout the page.</p>

      <div id="m2mblue-col2" style="width: 454px; height: 490.642px; margin-top: 16.967px; float: right; clear: right; background-color: #cfcfcf;"><span style="background-color: #3e6589; text-align: right; font-weight: 700; font-size: 14px; color: #ffffff; font-style: italic; padding-top: 4px; padding-bottom: 4px; padding-left: 316px;">https://m2mblue.com</span><p><span class="article-bold">Usability</span><br>
        When it comes to usability issues, there isn’t many that would arise. When a visitor first arrives to the site, the common layout and navigation structure allows them to know how they are expected to navigate the site in a matter of seconds, thus making the learnability easier for them. Once the visitor learns the nuances of the design and how the links and drop down menus work, it becomes very easy and quick for them to perform basic tasks such as switching pages and topics. With a relatively easy learnability, it becomes significantly easier for a user to return after a long period of time has passed and still retain the knowledge needed to perform basic tasks within the website. The quick adaptability to the websites nuances helps negate the opportunities to have mistakes or errors on the users part while exploring the site. Lastly, the pleasing design and layout comes from the strong use of contrast and balance between imagery and informational text.</p>
      <p><span class="article-bold">Content</span><br>
        The content within the site is high tech, detailed, and informative. Couple that with the content being high quality and constantly updated provides an excellent experience for the websites visitors and helps assist in the sale of the service the web page is providing.</p>
      <p><span class="article-bold">Design/Layout</span><br>
        The design has strong contrast, appropriate usage of typography and typographic theories, as well as excellent unity and balance that helps complete the composition and provide for a pleasing viewing experience. The webpage’s vibrant color scheme coupled with the great imagery help intrigue the viewer and help accomplish the sites goal by drawing the interest of many visitors, concluding with more costumers.<a href="#left-diagonal" class="back-to-top" style="color: black; position: absolute; z-index: 1; left: 855px; top: 1372px; width: 87px;">^ Back to Top ^</a></p>

      <p><span class="article-bold">Website Goal</span><br>
        The goal of <span class="article-bold">phoenix.cool</span> is to <span class="article-underline">promote itself</span>. The website is based around Phoenix which is a creative studio out of Montreal. Its focus is mainly on branding and interactive media.</p>
        <p><span class="article-bold">Target Audience</span><br>
        The target audience for the website is business, self-employed, or just anyone interested in branding and or interactive media. The age range that could be assigned to the target audience would most likely be in the range of <span class="article-bold">25–45</span> given that younger generations may not be as interested in branding or have a need for any interactive media while the same can be said for those who are older. There isn’t a pinpoint gender demographic that can be attached to the website but rather it is meant to include businesses mainly.</p>
        <p><span class="article-bold">Navigation</span><br>
        The types of navigation throughout the site are a top menu bar with textual links, a vertical scrolling method with no horizontal scrolling but rather links positioned on the aside for easy access when scrolling throughout the primary pages listed within the header navigation. All of the aforementioned primary pages have a consistent layout and structure where they are all vertical scrolling with linkage around the right side of the page and text and imagery flowing vertically. Thanks to various methods of breadcrumbs (URL and subtopics within each page) a user can always be aware of where they are on the website. Along with this, every link has an obvious location for the user to be taken and little is to be lost when attempting to navigate across the site. Lastly, the home page contains links to all primary topic pages and vice versa.</p></div><!-- End tag for #phoenix-col1 -->
      <div id="phoenix-col2" style="width: 454px; height: 534.308px; float: right; clear: right; background-color: #cfcfcf;"><span style="background-color: #3e6589; text-align: right; font-weight: 700; font-size: 14px; color: #ffffff; font-style: italic; padding-top: 4px; padding-bottom: 4px; padding-left: 323px;">https://phoenix.cool</span><p><span class="article-bold">Usability</span><br>
        As for possible usability issues that may arise would be that the navigation system is rather confusing at first with the exception of the header navigation. The vertical scrolling and various ways of navigate throughout pages and topics as well as sub pages and sub topics could cause confusion even though they are primarily common navigation and movements but are also injected with newer and difficult methods of scrolling and navigation. This could be deemed difficult for users that are entering the site for the first time, but once the user plays around with the website, they should be able to pickup the nuances after a short period of time. Once the user ends up understanding how the design and navigation of the site work, they can perform tasks with relative ease as the website stays consistent with its layout, navigation, and design all throughout. When it comes to memorability, problems may arise when it comes to when the user initially returns for the first time in a longer period of time, due to the weird and unique scrolling and movement methods in use, but once the user regains their understanding it should flow back naturally. Errors could arise if the visitor is attempting to navigate using methods that are thought to be in use but may not be constant through all pages and elements of the page, thus causing issues when one way of scrolling works at one point but not at another. Lastly, the contrast and vibrancy present within the design provide a pleasing experience when viewing the site.</p>
      <p><span class="article-bold">Content</span><br>
        The content is very high quality and is an updated snapshot at the work that the studio has done. Every image is crisp and detailed, each section of text is well written and informative. Overall the content within the site contains a constant professionalism throughout and is amplifies the professionalism that the company is trying to convey of themselves.</p>
      <p><span class="article-bold">Design/Layout</span><br>
        The design and layout contains a strong contrast with excellent depth, a clear hierarchy and grid structure, and a beautiful and vibrant color palette that is very appealing to the eyes. Overall the design makes for an exceptional and exciting viewing experience as well as showcasing the high quality content that the website has to offer.<a href="#left-diagonal" class="back-to-top" style="color: black; position: absolute; z-index: 1; left: 859px; top: 2384px; width: 87px;">^ Back to Top ^</a></p></div><!-- End tag for #phoenix-col2 -->

        The site goal for <span class="article-bold">frederiqueconstant.com</span> is to <span class="article-underline">sell luxury watches</span>. They sell both men’s and women’s watches.</p>
        <p><span class="article-bold">Target Audience</span><br>
        The target audience for the website looks to be both males and females, and can be narrowed down to an age range of approximately <span class="article-bold">30–60</span> given that most adults don’t reach their peak income levels until the age range of 35-54. Also if you take into consideration that the watches sold on the site are of high quality and a high price tag, younger generations tend to avoid such purchases until they are financially capable of making them and older generations tend to be little concern in luxury items as they get into their later years in life. Although the website sells both male and female versions of the products, I would deem the male demographic more of the target due to the higher presence of watches on males vs. females, although you could argue that due to that they would attempt to target females more.</p>
        <p><span class="article-bold">Navigation</span><br>
        The sites navigation is based off the very common occurrence of a primary navigation bar located within the header of the web page which provides all the links to the secondary pages. Another commonality that the website shares with many others would be the reliance on a main page with a vertical scroll which has sub-pages branching off of it. The main page has links, imagery, and arrows to assist the visitor in switching to other topics all from the initial home page. Unlike the previous sites I critiqued, this site doesn’t posses the same overly consistent approach when it comes to navigation and overall layout. Although this maybe due to the website having a main menu navigation bar along with various links within imagery as well as textually. The concerns with the consistency of the link usage would be only in the display of the link, when it comes to the titling of the links and how they operate, it remains fairly consistent. When it does come to clicking the links, the use of imagery and labeling, the visitor can easily recognize where it is the link is taking them.

        When it comes to possible usability issues, there aren’t many obvious ones for this website. Due to the sites usage of a top menu navigation as well as imagery with embedded links, it simplifies the usage of the navigation so that allows the new users to quickly learn how to perform basic tasks. When it comes to efficiency, the site visitors shouldn’t have any issues when it comes to effectively navigating the site and using the various pages/information. The sites implementation of very common navigation systems allows for the visitors to remember how the site works no matter how long its been since their last visit. The possibility for running into issues and having errors is minimal due to the design of the site and clear navigational tools as well as the simple layout. Lastly, the contrast and visual appeal make the experience and overall appearance of the web page very pleasing.</p>
      <p><span class="article-bold">Content</span><br>
        The content scattered throughout the website is very informative and the products they sell are clearly very high quality (and expensive). The luxury brand brings luxury content so that the consumer can tell they know what they are doing and what they are talking about. With new products and information constantly flowing in, the website is very current.</p>
      <p><span class="article-bold">Design/Layout</span><br>
        The layout and design of the website amplifies the luxuriousness of the product by coupling it with an elegant layout with detailed designs and high quality images that show that the company and its products are both luxurious, but full of integrity and elegance. The website is very balanced and has subtle contrast which provides a good amount of intrigue.<a href="#left-diagonal" class="back-to-top" style="color: black; position: absolute; z-index: 1; left: 856px; top: 3379px; width: 87px;">^ Back to Top ^</a></p></div><!-- End tag for #8-frederiqueconstant-col2 -->

        The site goal for <span class="article-bold">we3.jam3.com</span> is to <span class="article-underline">educate</span>. This is accomplished by providing internship opportunities to young and aspiring students of design and development. By combining the two and granting opportunities for young designers both in school and at most 2-years removed from school to get their foot in the door with some real world experience in the field.</p>
        <p><span class="article-bold">Target Audience</span><br>
        The target audience for the website would be young designers and developers around the ages of <span class="article-bold">16–24</span> given that the requirements to apply for the internships are that you are either in school (college/university) or at-most 2-years post-school which would narrow down the target audience significantly. Given that the spots are only given to designers and developers, it further narrows the target audience to a niche group of the market which helps funnel potential candidates to their website as well as turn away anyone who doesn’t mean the requirements. This method is perfectly fine for the website due to it being a secondary site for jam3.com which is the design company that the interns would work in and with during their internships.</p>
        <p><span class="article-bold">Navigation</span><br>
        As for navigation, there are several methods that a visitor is able to explore the web page. The site contains clearly identifiable links with distinct titling to allow the user to know where it is that the link will be taking them. The website abandoned the usage of the top navigation bar which is very common in web design these days and is often deemed essential. Instead of using navigation bars, the website opted for a rather modern approach by simply scrolling vertically from the home page until the user is faced with a choice. The page comes up with two choices and you are to pick either the Design or Development side to proceed throughout the website. Upon glancing through both, you get a similar layout, structure, verbiage, etc. But the main disparity would be that one favors the creative, design heavy side while the other is more methodical and technical on the development heavy side. After the visitor glances through both they notice that the links and navigation is mirrored over the y-axis and that both sides have access to the each other. Although the initial home page doesn’t contain any links, it does provide a path to the secondary page which could also be deemed the home page due to its access to all available links as well as indicating what the site is.</p></div><!-- End tag for #7-we3jam3-col1 -->
      <div id="we3jam3-col2" style="width: 454px; height: 584.149px; float: right; clear: right; background-color: #cfcfcf;"><span style="background-color: #3e6589; text-align: right; font-weight: 700; font-size: 14px; color: #ffffff; font-style: italic; padding-top: 4px; padding-bottom: 4px; padding-left: 311px;">https://we3.jam3.com</span><p><span class="article-bold">Usability</span><br>
        Possible usability issues that may arise could be the minimal explanation on the web page. Although this can be seen as a negative when it comes to learnability, it can deemed a positive when it comes to design because the minimal design and simplicity allows for a very pleasing display. When it comes to learnability, the visitor may at first struggle with the nuances that come with the navigation of a high-tech design website. After learning how the scrolling works and realizing that the home page has little importance other than grabbing the visitors attention and being fun to play with when scrolling across the visitor is quick to gain a grasp of how the navigation works. When it comes to efficiency, the user can quickly master the nuances and be able to explore both sides of the content to allow for a judgement to be made as to which side they would fall under. One plus to the memorability of the site would be since it contains a simplistic vertical scroll and minimal link usage, the user doesn’t need to hold onto large amounts of understanding as to how the website operates and how you’re meant to navigate it. This ties in well with the ability to run into errors because there isn’t many instances where a visitor could miss-click and get lost or run into an issue. Lastly, the overall display and design of the website draws the audience in due to the high levels of contrast and the crisp typography and imagery.</p>
      <p><span class="article-bold">Content</span><br>
        The content riddled throughout the site is pack full of excellent design verbiage and jargon which draws the audience in (even if they don’t fall under the target audience). The content is up to date, informative, and interesting while also providing contrasting sides and viewpoints on both ends of digital and graphic design (the design side and the development side). Although some of the content is mirrored between the two sides, it provides similarities among the large contrasting information and color. Overall the content is of high quality and the information is up to date and well written.</p>
      <p><span class="article-bold">Design/Layout</span><br>
        The web page contains sharp contrast, excellent use of typography and imagery to generate a sense of hierarchy while also being balanced and unified. Another positive is that web page uses emphasis to pull the visitor in and uses informative videos to hit home the point and to explain what jam3 does and what the we3 internship is all about. The excellent depth, use of color, and overall aesthetically pleasing look of the web page makes the  experience an exceptionally good one.<a href="#left-diagonal" class="back-to-top" style="color: black; position: absolute; z-index: 1; left: 857px; top: 4446px; width: 87px;">^ Back to Top ^</a></p></div><!-- End tag for #7-we3jam3-col2 -->

        The site goal for <span class="article-bold">bonhomme.lol</span> is to both <span class="article-underline">promote and sell a front-end developing service</span>. The site is essentially a portfolio for a web developer that primarily focuses on the front-end and appearance of websites. The goal is to both promote himself and his services, but to sell the product of his services in front-end development.</p>
        <p><span class="article-bold">Target Audience</span><br>
        The target audience for this front-end developer would most likely be adults in the age range of <span class="article-bold">18–40</span>. Usually those who need a freelance front-end developer to create a website would tend to be younger while those who are older than the aforementioned age range would be more likely to look to a company in the hopes that a team of developers could aid in the website development. Another quality that the target audience would posses would be that they  are looking for assistance in web design or have work for the freelancer.</p>
        <p><span class="article-bold">Navigation</span><br>
        The types of navigation within this website vary greatly than those of the previous websites I have critiqued. Although this website does have the typical navigation bar/tabs within the header, one unique quality they have is that they aren’t constantly in view like other sites implement, instead they are stationary within the header and don’t stay at the top of the web page once the user passes the fold of the website. Another unique element to the websites navigation is that upon scrolling, the wrapper of the page appears to remain constant and unmoved while the content of the page transitions similar to that of a power point. There isn’t any scrolling motion in fact, other than the imagery and body text switching to that of a secondary topic. The navigation is simplified and the design is elegant which allows the visitor to know exactly where they are due to breadcrumbs within the URL, very few pages, and a select number of topics/sub pages within the website. As for consistency, the website has a layout and design that goes unchanged throughout the whole site and the color scheme is very pleasing to the eyes and truly reflect the sites goal (darker color scheme with grid structure lines attempting to promote a front-end web developer). All the links within the website are clearly labeled and indicate where you’re being taken to if you were to click. The home page of the website contains various topics as well as links to all secondary pages, thus presenting all available information site wide to the visitor within the home page.</p></div><!-- End tag for #6-bonhomme-col1 -->

        The usability issues within the website are miniscule due to the website containing a pleasing design, structured layout, and simplistic navigation system. As for learnability, a visitor to the site should easily be able to navigate throughout the website because the system is fairly common and the layout is easy to understand. The navigation links within the header coupled with the maximum 3 pages allow for a quick introduction to how a visitor is to navigate the site. As for efficiency, due to the simple and quick learnability a user can be efficiently navigating the website in a matter of seconds, with virtually zero risk of error. Lastly, for the memorability I don’t see any reason as to why anyone would have issues remembering how to explore the site no matter what length of time it’s been since they last visited. Overall the lack of issues when it comes to usability allows the visitor to truly enjoy the experience that the website gives, and can come away with a better understand of who Maxime Bonhomme is and what he has to offer.</p>
      <p><span class="article-bold">Content</span><br>
        The content within the website is clear, to the point and of the highest quality. The short bursts of body text allows for a quick read and doesn’t bore the visitor with needless information. The clean layout and design make viewing the content a good experience while also enabling further exploration by allowing the visitor to click forward to the website in use. All the information is up to date and current. </p>
      <p><span class="article-bold">Design/Layout</span><br>
        As for the design and layout of the website, It is exceptional in various categories. This is required for a front-end web developer because it presents him professionally and gives a showcase of his work. Given that the website is mostly designed by the web designer its promoting, it must possess good design elements and principles to further promote himself. The grid structure, use of hierarchy, and the contrast are of high quality while overall design is pleasing to the eye and providing an exceptional viewing experience.<a href="#left-diagonal" class="back-to-top" style="color: black; position: absolute; z-index: 1; left: 857px; top: 5477px; width: 87px;">^ Back to Top ^</a></p></div><!-- End tag for #6-bonhomme-col2 -->

        The site goal for <span class="article-bold">clarity.io</span> is to both <span class="article-underline">educate and inform the reader</span>. They aim to educate the public as well as cities on ways to clean up the air and prevent air pollution while also informing them on how to do so.</p>
        <p><span class="article-bold">Target Audience</span><br>
        The target audience for this site is a little different than most. Given that they aren’t actually attempting to sell anything (other than the increased use of their product that is aimed to gather data on air quality) but rather attempting to inform and educate everyone on the need for better air quality control as well as better and more efficient technology to be used to gather the data on the air quality.</p>
        <p><span class="article-bold">Navigation</span><br>
        The navigation that is spread throughout the website is simple and elegant as well as minimal. The websites navigation is centered around the generic vertical scroll but is used in unison with other elements such as moving animations and 3d diagrams. Upon scrolling vertically you in essence switch across pages which differs slightly from the norm which is usually just one long page being moved up and down. The difference with this scrolling method is that as you scroll, the animations and page appear to move into differing locations as well new text and information being revealed, almost as if its a vertically moving power point with advanced animations and diagrams. Along with this unique scrolling method, there is also a menu icon indicated in the right header of the page and is present throughout the website to allow for a consistent method of navigation. The presence of titles and subtitles throughout the website help aid the user in knowing what part of the site they are viewing and the menu bar allows them to jump from page to page if the scrolling method isn’t their desired method. All the links are clearly labeled and allow the user to know exactly where they are navigating to. Along with the use of clearly identifiable links, the user is also able to navigate across the site with ease all from the home page, due to all the links to the secondary pages being available in the menu bar.

        As for possible usability issues, learnability should be fairly easy. Although there is a large presence of moving objects and animations across the pages, the vertical scrolling and obvious menu bar should provide some comfort to the user and allow for a relatively easy experience at first. One benefit to the learnability would be the limited amount of text within the few pages throughout the website. There is approximately 5 or so individual pages that all branch off the home page (index.html) and all come up by the vertical scrolling. Within these pages there is roughly 3-5 sentences and a title or two, which attributes to an easy read and allows the user to navigate through the whole site in a matter of 10-20 seconds. Once the user gains an understanding of how the navigation is meant to be used, its relatively easy to understand and use efficiently. Given the simple page layouts and fairly normal scrolling, it should remain easy to navigate for a user even after months of absence from the site. Lastly, due to the website having very few pages and not possessing an intricate and difficult navigation system a visitor should be able to maneuver throughout the website with ease and no fear of getting lost or having issues with errors. Even if there was an error to arise, it wouldn’t be anything that the visitor couldn’t resolve by simply clicking back to the home page. Also the design of the website allows for a very pleasant and entertaining experience while also assisting in informing and educating the user. </p>
      <p><span class="article-bold">Content</span><br>
        The content on clarity.io is very detailed and educational but is also simplified to allow for an easy read and to gain the interest of the subject that is viewing the content. Alongside the informational text and diagrams that are scattered throughout the website, the use of a very informative “about” video towards the footer of the web page allows for a quick understanding of what clarity is and what they are doing to help aid in combating the air pollution problem that is plaguing busy cities in the united states as well as across the globe. The content within the site is used very effectively alongside the sites goal to inform and educate. Lastly, the site’s content is up to date and appears to be gained from using some of the latest technology when it comes to combating air pollution.</p>
      <p><span class="article-bold">Design/Layout</span><br>
        The design and layout of the web page is superb and ties in well with their message and goal. The light blue contrasting with the white negative space allows for subtle contrast that causes enough intrigue and depth without being polar opposites and too eye catching, this gains the users attention at first and allows the text and information speak for itself without pulling the attention away from the information by using diagrams and animations that are distracting. The light blue color scheme also aids in conveying what the website is about. When one thinks of clean air they think of vibrant blue skies, while when someone thinks technology and someone with integrity and sophistication they think of blue or gray. The combination of those color theories alongside the fact that bright blue shows that clarity is modern and new. Overall the web page comes off as informative, sophisticated, current, and good for the environment while the information and content further press that point. The grid structure, use of animation, as well as intricate diagrams show that they know what they are doing and what they are talking about. The design of the website screams a strong presence of creativity mixed with an advanced knowledge of technology, the environment, design, and advertising/marketing.<a href="#left-diagonal" class="back-to-top" style="color: black; position: absolute; z-index: 1; left: 857px; top: 6742px; width: 87px;">^ Back to Top ^</a></p></div><!-- End tag for #5-clarity-col2 -->

        The site goal for <span class="article-bold">assos.com</span> is to <span class="article-underline">sell apparel for cycling</span>. This could be anything from cycling shorts, sun glasses, to helmets.</p>
        <p><span class="article-bold">Target Audience</span><br>
        The target audience would be cyclists around the ages of <span class="article-bold">25–45</span>. I came to this conclusion due to the high quality that is found in the products made by assos as well as the high price range. Given that the products appear to be made for serious cyclists, I deemed that ages 25 and up would limit the audience to only those who are extremely invested in the world of cycling. As for gender, I would lean slightly towards males due to the strong presence in males in the professional cycling world but there is a fairly close split across the genders. Cyclists which are the primary audience for assos can come from all sorts of financial situations but given the price tag on the quality product that they sell, I would eliminate any customers who may deem cycling as a hobby and limit it to those who are passionate about cycling and willing to spend large amounts of money to enhance the overall cycling experience.</p>
        <p><span class="article-bold">Navigation</span><br>
        As for navigation on the website, it is fairly intricate when compared to the previous sites. Although the navigation is obvious and clear when it comes to where its located and where each link leads, there is a large amount of pages and sub pages due to the website selling a large amount of various products within different categories. With all this in mind, they need to have quite a lot of links so that no matter what a cyclist (part of the target audience) would be looking for, they could locate a page or pages that can narrow down the select products. If a male cyclist looking for a cycling jersey and tends to cycle more in the colder temperatures/seasons (spring and fall) he would be able to navigate to the male section on the top navigation bar, then proceed to look under clothing for jerseys, after getting to jerseys he would then be able to narrow down his search to only include long sleeve jerseys, thus narrowing down the long list of products for sale to the specific product he is searching for. This form of navigation could be confusing when attempting to find what category the product you’d like would be under, but once you find general thing you are searching for, you are easily able to narrow it down to exactly what you’d like. The vertical navigation bar is located at the header and uses text links to warp the user throughout the site to whatever thing they would be interested in. Consistency is very evident throughout the website where the layout and color scheme stay the same but products, imagery, and titling switch when the user goes from topic to topic. The adjustment aids the user in knowing exactly where they are and what they are looking at. One flaw with the user knowing where they are would be the lack of breadcrumbs although this is alleviated when you take into account that the top menu bar is always present and has a large assortment of various links to send you back or forward to wherever you’d like. Every link within the site is descriptive so that the visitor is able to navigate with ease and have no concerns as to where they are going or where to find a specific item. All the links to all the pages and sub pages are available on any given page which adds to the convenience given to the user by the presence of a navigation bar.</p></div><!-- End tag for #4-assos-col1 -->
      <div id="assos-col2" style="width: 454px; height: 716.524px; float: right; clear: right; background-color: #cfcfcf;"><span style="background-color: #3e6589; text-align: right; font-weight: 700; font-size: 14px; color: #ffffff; font-style: italic; padding-top: 4px; padding-bottom: 4px; padding-left: 339px;">https://assos.com</span><p><span class="article-bold">Usability</span><br>
        Given that the website uses a fairly common structure for its navigation, the learnability should be really quick. The obvious navigation bar and well labeled links within distinctive categories allows the users to know exactly where to click to find whatever they are looking for. One issue that may arise at first for the visitor when it comes to learning how to navigate the site could be the large amounts of links and pages, but anyone who knows what they would like to get or look at would have a relatively easy time doing so. This site wouldn’t suit a user who is looking to just see what is available, at first because there are various links and lots of differing products. Once the user learns how to navigate the site and find items, it will become second nature and very easy and efficient. Due to the site using a very common structure to how users navigate across the site, returning users shouldn’t have any issues with performing tasks no matter how long they’ve been away from the website. One error that could arise would be not knowing where a specific item would be listed under or accidently looking under the wrong category (i.e. looking for sunglasses/eye wear under accessories when it is actually under collaborations). As for the design and how it comes off, I would say it is very pleasant to the target audience because it shows the products in use, gives specifications about each product, and the various colors and sizes helps include everyone.</p>
      <p><span class="article-bold">Content</span><br>
        The content similar to the products is of very high quality. Upon first glance, a visitor can clearly tell that this is a website dedicated to cycling and doing so efficiently and professionally. Although some simplicity is involved throughout the site which aids in including those who are more into cycling as a hobby and don’t live on their bike. All the products and information is updated frequently and is of exceptional quality.</p>
      <p><span class="article-bold">Design/Layout</span><br>
        The design and layout is very detailed and vibrant. The large imagery allows the visitors to see the products in action and helps show the theme of the website. As for layout the grid structure is very effectively and balanced, whether it be combining a large image on top of a list of products next to an aside with filters to narrow down the product range.<a href="#left-diagonal" class="back-to-top" style="color: black; position: absolute; z-index: 1; left: 857px; top: 7949px; width: 87px; height: 15px;">^ Back to Top ^</a></p></div><!-- End tag for #4-assos-col2 -->

        The goal for <span class="article-bold">themarcus.com</span> is to both <span class="article-underline">promote Marcus Eriksson (a photographer) as well as to act as a form of entertainment</span> by showcasing his work.</p>
        <p><span class="article-bold">Target Audience</span><br>
        The target audience for the website could be almost anyone, due to the large spectrum of photographs and the people within the photographs. Due to the large presence of sports stars and the popular brands such as Nike and Beats the target audience could be narrowed down to primarily males (could be a small portion of females)  around the ages of <span class="article-bold">12–35</span>. All the athletes are seen as role models for young kids and are often admired by younger adults. Given the strong presence of social media and photography in the younger generations, the age range does favor the lower half slightly (12–25). </p>
        <p><span class="article-bold">Navigation</span><br>
        The navigation within the website appears to be very minimal. In fact there doesn’t appear to be a menu or navigation bar at all. The only element that is relatively close to a menu bar would be a drop down list with contact information as well as some quotes. As for switching pages throughout the site, it appears to only be done by clicking on an example photograph which directs the visitor to the collection of other photographs that accompany it. When a visitor is exploring the site, the simplicity allows them the freedom to explore without any confusion and the breadcrumbs in the URL address allow the user to know exactly what they are viewing and allow for easy access back to the home page as well as clicking an icon in the upper right of the header. The site oozes consistency when it comes to color, hierarchy, structure, layout. Everything about the site remains constant no matter what page you are on or what photograph you click on. All the links and photographs are labeled correctly which allows the viewer to accurately navigate the site and know exactly where they are going once they click the link/photograph.</p></div><!-- End tag for #3-themarcus-col1 -->

        The learnability within this site allows the visitors to easily navigate across the site due to the simple and minimal navigation as well as a good use of labeling and hierarchy that makes the content easy to navigate through. Given that the navigation and usability is a quick learn, a user can efficiently navigate throughout the website in a matter of seconds. Along with the easy learnability and how efficiently a user is able to navigate the website, the memorability would be second to none. Since there is no confusing or complicated navigation tactics, the users can easily remember how to move across the site weeks, months, even years after their initial visit. Given all the aforementioned usability considerations, there is very few ways a visitor would be making errors when using the site. Given the simplistic design and very effective use of contrast, hierarchy and grid structure, the website as a whole is very appealing and would be a pleasant viewing experience for anyone.</p>
      <p><span class="article-bold">Content</span><br>
        Given that the website as a whole consists solely of imagery, It has an excellent amount of content while having an extremely small amount of text to accompany it. Although the lack of text could appear as a negative, it allows the viewer to truly draw their own conclusion and form their own opinions in regards to the imagery being shown to them. The lack of much text also fits the minimalistic feel that the website exudes. Lastly, the small amount of text that is present throughout the site is clear enough to inform the users and makes sense although there is very little being said. All the images that are posted throughout the website are up to date and current.</p>
      <p><span class="article-bold">Design/Layout</span><br>
        This website uses various design principles that help aid the simplistic look. There is an excellent use of contrast between the lighter color website background with the darker imagery creating a very good amount of depth and intrigue. As for grid structure and hierarchy, the website provides this and helps draw in the viewer so that they truly capture the attention of the reader. Typography is simplistic and help aid the minimalistic scheme that is evident throughout the website.<a href="#left-diagonal" class="back-to-top" style="color: black; position: absolute; z-index: 1; left: 857px; top: 8949px; width: 87px; height: 15px;">^ Back to Top ^</a></p></div><!-- End tag for #3-themarcus-col2 -->

        The goal for <span class="article-bold">thenewmobileworkforce.com </span>is to <span class="article-underline">educate its visitors on the advancements within racing</span>. </p>
        <p><span class="article-bold">Target Audience</span><br>
        The target audience for the website appears to be similar to that of racing which is adult males from the ages of <span class="article-bold">20–50</span>. Similar to that of Nascar and other forms of racing, Formula racing brings in a large spectrum of age groups (majority being males) with the age range of 20–50 making up upwards of 70% of the total fans. Navigation across the site is also another way of predicting an age range and target audience due to differing levels of difficulty as well as the overall experience. Since this website’s navigation is more towards the difficult end of the spectrum and is extremely intricate and could easily confuse older visitors to the site I would take out the older half of the aforementioned age range. Taking the navigation and overall intricacy of the site, I would say that the target audience’s age is somewhere between the ages of 20–35. </p>
        <p><span class="article-bold">Navigation</span><br>
        The website has a very confusing navigation system in place when a visitor is first introduced to the site. Personally it took me a minute or two to understand how I was to scroll and navigate through the page until I realized the horizontal scroll feature. Although the navigation is primarily a horizontal scroll with a few pages branching off vertically there is still a top menu bar that when clicked becomes a horizontal list that appears centered on the page. The website is fairly consistent with its placement of links and their titling. As for the links and the location of the website they take the user, it remains consistent and the visitor always knows where the link is taking them. The home page uses the menu bar efficiently thus allowing the user to navigate to every page of the website straight from the home page. The menu bar also allows the visitor to navigate to all other of the main pages from any given page that the user is on. </p></div><!-- End tag for #2-thenewmobileworkforce-col1 -->

        As for possibly usability issues within the site, there is a few elements to the site that may confuse a user at first. Upon a visitors initial visit, they may encounter issues with the learnability of the site due to the presence of a horizontal scroll and very little of vertical scrolling. Given that a large majority of sites stick to the horizontal scrolling method due to it being commonplace, it might be confusing to the user who are attempting to scroll and are doing so in the opposite manner. As for the efficiency of the navigation, I found that once someone begins understanding the scrolling and various navigation elements they should be able to operate and use them very quickly and effectively. Although users may pick up on the nuances of the navigation, I think there may be a slight issue if the users don’t visit the site for a longer duration of time and they may forget about the horizontal scroll, Although once they do remember the odd navigation it should come back relatively quick. The only issue would be upon first returning back to the site and possibly forgetting how the navigation is to be operated.</p>
      <p><span class="article-bold">Content</span><br>
        The content within the site is very detail orientated and extremely descriptive but also short and to the point. Given that the site is about racing and the race car itself, it must be rich with information regarding the two to allow for visitors to gain a knowledge and understand of what the website is actually talking about. While information and attention to detail is important to this site as is the previous site, you still need to be able to quickly inform the visitor and prevent the loss of interest. The easiest way to keep a readers attention is to not bore them with random and non-important information that they will quickly skip over and eventually off the website. This site does a very good job at limiting the amount of information into short bursts of information and usually staying within a few sentences of text. The content within the site appears updated and current which is backed up by the text talking about all the brand new improvements to the car.</p>
      <p><span class="article-bold">Design/Layout</span><br>
        The design and layout of the website is eye catching to say the least. The use of bright colors and amazing quality graphics improves the overall experience for the visitor while also throwing in informative content alongside the imagery. There doesn’t appear to be a very distinctive grid structure across most of the pages and it seems to be a more loose grid due to some pages looking identical and having a similar structure while others vary and change page to page. The animation that is scattered throughout the sites allows for an interactive experience and aids in the design of the site and makes the website enjoyable while it is still rich with knowledge.<a href="#left-diagonal" class="back-to-top" style="color: black; position: absolute; z-index: 1; left: 857px; top: 10053px; width: 87px; height: 15px;">^ Back to Top ^</a></p></div><!-- End tag for #2-thenewmobileworkforce-col2 -->

        The goal for <span class="article-bold">neematic.com</span> is to sell us <span class="article-underline">“The World’s most powerful electric bike” </span>which happens to be the only bike that the company (Neematic) sells. The bike is The Neematic FR/1 </p>
        <p><span class="article-bold">Target Audience</span><br>
        The target audience for the website appears to be young adult males ranging from the ages of <span class="article-bold">15–35</span>. This is evident by the product being a motorized vehicle which indicates that children are usually excluded. The dark layout and detail used when describing the product also indicates that the adults interested in the product are younger and more incline to explore the website and take into consideration the specifications of the product. Another reasoning as to why the age range is younger would be the use of social media marketing to aid in selling their product.</p>
        <p><span class="article-bold">Navigation</span><br>
        As for navigation, the website has a fairly simple flow to their website although it could confuse those who aren’t tech savvy (which would likely be those outside the target audience). Neematic uses a drop-down menu list that is stationary and aligned left within the header. They also consistently use hierarchy and titles to allow the visitor to always know where he/she is. Along with consistent hierarchy, the website also has a consistent layout, color scheme, and grid structure. One knock on the website is the reliance on the menu, the visitor has to use the menu to navigate and doesn’t offer much else when it comes to navigating across the pages. Although due to the audience and simplicity in content, the website can get away with a very minimalistic and direct use of navigation. In conclusion, the navigation is superb due to its simplicity and provides awareness for  the visitor. </p></div><!-- End tag for #1-neematic-col1 -->

        As for usability within the website, I’d first start off with the Learnability. When a first-time visitor enters the site, they are capable of performing basic tasks but may have to take a moment to adjust to how the website’s navigation works. After learning the nuances of the navigation, the experience becomes very enjoyable and will be remembered if the visitor is to return after a longer period of time. Another benefit for the usability on the website would be the simplicity allowing for a lack of errors for a visitor. Lastly, the layout and design used site wide is pleasant to the visitor and is relaxed and simple but still informative</p>
      <p><span class="article-bold">Content</span><br>
        The content scattered throughout the site is both an easy read but allows the visitor to learn something that makes the product what it is. This is achieved by informing the visitor with short amounts of body text underneath some display text to allow the visitor to pick and choose what they are looking for. Given that the text is minimal, it allows the visitor to read relatively quick which prevents boredom and the content from going unread. The content on the website is up to date and appears to change periodically which allows the visitor to know that what they are reading is relevant.</p>
      <p><span class="article-bold">Design/Layout</span><br>
        As for the Design and Layout of the page, I mentioned earlier that the site has a fantastic use of grid, color palette, and hierarchy. As for the typography used and photos, they are easy to read/view and are minimal which allows them to unify well with the color palette. There is excellent balance and contrast within the site due to the smart usage of lights and darks to provide visual intrigue for the viewer.<a href="#left-diagonal" class="back-to-top" style="color: black; position: absolute; z-index: 1; left: 857px; top: 10963px; width: 87px; height: 15px;">^ Back to Top ^</a></p></div><!-- End tag for #1-neematic-col2 -->
